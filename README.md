# DRF Shop

We try to provide an online shop's basic models, serializers, and views. So you
can quickly create a shopping website. Usually, there are many complicated
logics behind every shopping system that you have to consider, So using a
package to do the basics for us is a good practice.

# Installation

```shell
pip install drf-shop
```

Or, if you want the latest version, you can directly install the package from
the source code:

```shell
pip install https://github.com/xanigo/drf-shop/archive/refs/heads/master.zip
```

Or using git:

```shell
pip install git+ssh://git@github.com/xanigo/drf-shop.git
```
